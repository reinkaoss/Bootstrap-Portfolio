# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This Bootstrap4-based challenge is a repeat of the prior one that involved reading.
The primary driving force behind creating this project was familiarisation with Bootstrap4's capabilities, syntax, and, most importantly, grid system.
This project is the first phase in my final portfolio, which I've created. It might modify and add more information in the near future.
It largely resolved the responsiveness difficulties I encountered with the first version, which just utilised the CSS grid scheme.
Building this project taught me how flexible Bootstrap is and how easy and natural its grid-building syntax can be.
